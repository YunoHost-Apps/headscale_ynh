Recent versions of Headscale have introduced breaking changes in the configuration file (`__INSTALL_DIR__/config.yaml`).
If you have customized it, please back it up in a safe location before continuing this upgrade.
Afterwards, you may reapply your modifications.

Note that nodes' MagicDNS will not contain the username anymore: `device.user.base_domain.tld` will become `device.base_domain.tld`
