This upgrade of Headscale follows a revamping of Dex. You need to upgrade Dex to v2.42.1~ynh4 or above first.
Dex can now be used by multiple apps at the same time (instead of currently needing one instance of Dex per app needing OIDC).

This upgrade will overwrite your configuration file (`__INSTALL_DIR__/config.yaml`).
If you have customized it, please back it up in a safe location before continuing this upgrade.
Afterwards, you may reapply your modifications.
